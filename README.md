## üöÄ First-Time Setup

Before you can run this script in fully automated mode, you **must run it once with the browser visible** to upload your ROS certificate manually.

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. Run the script with `--headless=false`:
   ```bash
   node index.js --headless=false
   ```
2. In the browser window that opens:
   - Upload your ROS digital certificate if it's not already loaded.
   - Select the appropriate certificate from the dropdown.
   - If a password is provided (via `.env` or `--password`), it will be auto-filled.
   - Manually click the **"Login to ROS"** button.

3. After successful login, the certificate will remain loaded in the browser profile.

Once this is done, you can run the script in headless mode from then on:
```bash
node index.js
```

## üö¶ Usage

```bash
node index.js [--headless=false] [--cert=name] [--password=pass] [--noemail]
```

### Options
- `--headless=false`: Run in visible mode (useful for uploading certificate)
- `--cert`: Certificate name (overrides `.env`)
- `--password`: Certificate password (overrides `.env`)
- `--noemail`: Skip email, save data to local `inbox_data.json`

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Output
- `inbox.png`: Screenshot of the inbox
- `after-click.png`: Screenshot after login
- `debug.html`: Optional HTML dump if scraping fails
- `inbox_data.json`: Inbox data if `--noemail` is used
